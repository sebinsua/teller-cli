## FAQ

#### Compiling gives `openssl/hmac.h` not found error

Ensure that both [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) and `openssl` are installed, and then [try running `brew link --force openssl`](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/issues/255).

This relates to the following error:

```
--- stderr
src/openssl_shim.c:1:10: fatal error: 'openssl/hmac.h' file not found
#include <openssl/hmac.h>
```
